# ML/DL From Scratch in Pure C

This project is a personal exploration into **machine learning and deep learning** implemented purely in **C**, with **no external libraries**.  
The goal is to deeply understand ML/DL algorithms and improve low-level programming skills.

---

## Project Goals

- Reinforce understanding of core ML/DL concepts  
- Practice low-level implementation and memory management  
- Build intuition by avoiding black-box libraries  
- Improve C programming and algorithmic thinking
